          After graduating with a Master's degree in{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">Economics</span> and working as
          an&nbsp;Accountant for a&nbsp;few years, I&nbsp;decided to follow my
          curiosity about programming. I&nbsp;enrolled in a&nbsp;coding bootcamp
          where I&nbsp;learned{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">front-end development</span> and earned
          the title of&nbsp;
          <span className="font-bold">JavaScript Developer</span> along with
          a&nbsp;certificate.
        </p>
        {/* <br></br> */}
        <p>
          Before I started learning{" "}
          <span className="italic font-bold">HTML, CSS,</span> and{" "}
          <span className="italic font-bold">JavaScript</span> I&nbsp;thought of
          programming as a&nbsp;kind of magic, but as I&nbsp;studied it,
          I&nbsp;realized itâ€™s a&nbsp;fascinating, methodical and enjoyable
          thing to do. Now, I&nbsp;can't even imagine coding not being a part of
          my daily life.
        </p>
        <p className=" indent-3">
          <span className="italic">My favorite aspect of programming</span> is
          planning and breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable parts. I{" "}
          <span className="underline">love</span> the satisfaction of solving
          problems and seeing everything I&nbsp;planned come together and work
          as intended. I primarily work with
          <span className="font-bold"> React</span>, and use{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">TypeScript</span> daily. I&nbsp;am
          continuously learning and gradually implementing new tools and
          technologies, such as <span className="font-bold">Next.js</span> and{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">Tailwind CSS, MUI</span> into my projects.
          Collaboration, clear communication, and a user-first mindset are at
          the core of my professional approach.
        </p>

        <p className=" indent-3">
          <span className="italic">When I'm not coding</span>, I&nbsp;like
          reading travel books and articles about Japan, watching movies, and
          cooking Asian food. I am currently learning to meditate. I&nbsp;also
          really love traveling, planning new trips, and meeting new people.
